# EDA-attack-on-titanic
In this notebook, an exploratory data analysis was performed on the Titanic datasets extracted from [Kaggle] with focus on gathering relevant analyses, patterns, and insights. This work is intended to serve as a well-grounded foundation which will be helpful in generating the model to predict the solution goal further down the line.  

I am very thrilled to present this first project. I am still a novice as I venture my journey in this field of data science and machine learning so any form of feedback and recommendation for my work are welcome. I am always looking forward to hear them out and take this opportunity to learn more things and to further enhance my skills.
