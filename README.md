# EDA-attack-on-titanic
In this notebook, I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic datasets extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), with focus on gathering relevant analyses, patterns, and insights. This work is intended to serve as a well-grounded foundation which will be helpful in generating the model to predict the solution goal further down the line.  

## Specific Objectives
The purpose of the notebook is to practice Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization in line with going through the following workflow stages:
- **Comprehend.** Understand the nature and relationships among each features in the datasets
- **Correlate.** Validate the strength of association across features with the appopriate statistical tools and metrics based on the distributions and data types of the features.
- **Control.** Identify and remedy the missing/null values. May consider imputing them for features that are deemed significant.  
- **Convert.** Perform the necessary adjustments (i.e. one-hot encoding) to make the datasets appropriate for modelling.
- **Create.** Create new features out of the given features that may follow and improve the correlations with the solution goal.
- **Conclude.** Generate the final training set with the significantly correlated features ready for modelling.

## Background of the Problem
The complete overview and description of the Kaggle competition be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are some of information we were provided with the link.
- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.
- Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
- While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.


I am very thrilled to present this first project. I am still a novice as I venture my journey in this field of data science and machine learning so any form of feedback and recommendation for my work are welcome. I am always looking forward to hear them out and take this opportunity to learn more things and to further enhance my skills.
